# Infinity types.

The terminogy for `_:` namespace of [MFT-1](https://book.mindey.com/metaformat/0002-data-object-format/0002-data-object-format.html).

See the repo [wiki](../../wiki) for content.

The aim of this wiki is to work as an organized enrichment to all ontologies (such as [schema.org](https://schema.org)) relying on the concept of `Thing` or `Entity` to explain and summarize all web data and objects, by providing superclasses to the `Thing` class. This vocabulary is designed from the first principles to decompose the [equation model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3wpZ7yWUNg), namely `F(X)=Y`, where `F` is the world, `Y` is our dream, and `X` is us, who parametrize the world to make equality: `world(we) = dream`. It is outlined and published at [wefindx.net](https://wefindx.net).

## Central Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** `Agents` set [`Goals` about the `Needs`] regarding (`World: Agents, Assets, Events, Places, Topics`) and pursue them by coming up with [`Ideas`, from which they derive `Plans` as networks of `Steps`] to realize them, and instantiate the `Steps` (prototypes for action) as actual `Actions` (world parametrization events). See [details](https://wefindx.net/rationale.html).

**Interpretation:** Under different circumstances and in different contexts, `Things` acquire aspects of multiple of these categories. For example, a `"Human"` is obviously a process that continues over space and time, therefore a `"Human"` may fall under the category of `"Event"` in time, or even a `"Place"` in space, and, as a process, it may also qualify as an instance of `"Idea"` (as an expression of genome, which is a program, which is a `"Plan"` for this process). It may also qualify for being a `"Goal"` (for parents who gave birth to the `"Human"`), or an `"Asset"` for an organization, or even a `"Step"` (or part) of some larger social scheme of things. It can be a `"Topic"` in context of parties strategically thinking (reasoning, conceptualizing) about it.

The same could be said about many other things. For example, analogously the `"Sun"` is also a process continuing over space and time (`"Event"` and `"Place"`), an instance (a `"Plan"`) of an idea of certain nuclear reactions under gravity, as a program of their initial states, which may also be an `"Idea"` of the basic constants of the universe (and the plan - their expression), an `"Asset"` for beings or planetary system or galaxy. It may also qualify as a `"Goal"` (for particles tied together by gravity as their common urge), or as a `"Step"` (in evolution of life, the galaxy, or other long multi-part processes).

**Conclusion** If we look at this vocabulary more broadly, it appears that that pretty much everything has of these aspects identified by this vocabulary (no wonder curious kids ask these questions about things), and the world cannot be understood completely without understanding the true meaning of things, that this vocabulary provides. Incidentally, each of these terms in the vocabulary answer an essential questions about `"Things"`.

**Implications:** Since these categories appear to be properties of all `"Things"`, it is reasonable to treat them as shared properties of all `"Things"`, and require answers to questions about all of them to consider things _contextually understood_:

## Superclasses of "Thing"

- `Thing(F, X, Y)`:
  - `F(domain).assets`:
    - `.Agent` (who?)
    - `.Place` (where?)
    - `.Event` (when?)
    - `.Topic` (about what?)
  - `X(process).actions`:
    - . `doing`
  - `Y(range).targets`:
    - `.Goal` (why?)
    - `.Idea` (how in principle?)
    - `.Plan` (what specifically?)
    - `.Step` (in what order?)

Here, `Thing` inherits from the equation model `F, X, Y`. Treating all things as instances of equation model (or on-going optimization processes), we can start building a comprehensive world model of connected intelligence that has these answers about every thing. This can be done by identifying subjects of interests, listing them, and linking answers to the above questions about them.

The above listing of questions may be not entirely understood, because of the limitations of English, therefore, here is a more comprehensive attempt to cover them through providing more synonyms. The `F`, `X`, and `Y` decomposes into:

- **Everything** _(synonym: Entities, Things)_
  - **World** (`F`) _(synonym: **Substance**)_
    - [[Asset]] _(synonyms: Variable, Thing, Subject)_
      - [[Agent]] _(`Q: who?`, synonyms: instance of process `X` from `F(X)=Y` (i.e., Process performing of `world` cognition [read], `action` [write], `volition` [auto-deriving target state]))_
      - [[Place]] _(`Q: where?`, synonyms: Space constraint content)_
      - [[Event]] _(`Q: when?`, synonyms: Time constraint content)_
      - [[Topic]] _(`Q: about what?`, synonyms: Conceptual constraint, Definition)_
  - **We** (`X`) _(synonym: **Process**)_
    - [[Action]] _(`A: doing.`, synonyms: Parameter transfer, State modification, Write/Update)_
  - **Dream** (`Y`) _(synonym: **Essence**)_
    - [[Need]] _(synonyms: Variable target range, Condition, Intent)_
      - [[Goal]] _(`Q: why?`, synonyms: Intents, Vector target domain, Conditions)_
      - [[Idea]] _(`Q: how?`, synonyms: Variable Transform, Principle, Method, Invention)_
      - [[Plan]] _(`Q: what?`, synonyms: Project, Company, Organization)_
      - [[Step]] _(`Q: in what order?`, synonyms: Part)_

**Take away:** we can ask these questions about every line of code, every law and regulation, every known molecule in our bodies, every instance of data from arbitrary ontology. They are superclasses ("parents") of `"Thing"` (or `"Entity"`) class.

To specify the answers to these questions, we must inevitably treat things in relation to contexts. For example, we can ask the answers to these questions about instances of subclasses of `Thing` or `Entity` of any ontology (like `schema.org`, `wikidata.org`, etc.) to understand their instances as part of an equation.
